Your weekend includes 2 hours on Saturday for exploring AI branches and 2 hours on Sunday for reviewing the week's material.

**Week 2: Machine Learning Core Concepts and Supervised Learning**
*   **Focus:** This week delves into supervised learning, covering regression (linear, logistic) and classification (SVM, Decision Trees). You'll also learn about data preprocessing, model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE), and implementing basic ML algorithms with Scikit-learn.
*   **Daily Breakdown:** Similar to Week 1, Monday to Friday evenings (18:00-20:00) are for studying and practicing supervised learning and data preprocessing. Saturday includes 2 hours for hands-on Scikit-learn implementation, and Sunday is for reviewing Week 2's content.

**Week 3: Unsupervised Learning and Introduction to Deep Learning**
*   **Focus:** You'll explore unsupervised learning techniques like clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA). The week then transitions into the basics of neural networks (perceptrons, activation functions, backpropagation) and an introduction to deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch), culminating in building a simple feedforward neural network.
*   **Daily Breakdown:** Evening sessions (18:00-20:00) from Monday to Friday will cover unsupervised learning and neural network theory. On Saturday, you'll spend 2 hours introducing deep learning frameworks and building your first simple neural network. Sunday is reserved for reviewing the concepts from Week 3.

**Week 4: Practical Applications and Project Building**
*   **Focus:** The final week is dedicated to practical application. You'll work on a small end-to-end AI project (e.g., image classification, text sentiment), learn about data versioning and basic model deployment, research specialized AI topics, and conduct a comprehensive review of everything you've learned.
*   **Daily Breakdown:** Monday to Wednesday evenings (18:00-20:00) are dedicated to your AI project, from setup and data preparation to model development, evaluation, and refinement. Thursday and Friday evenings (18:00-20:00) will cover data versioning, model deployment basics, and researching specialized AI topics. The weekend includes 2 hours on Saturday for consolidating challenging concepts and a final review on Sunday, along with planning your next steps in AI.

This agenda provides a structured overview. Remember to adjust task depth and allocate more time to challenging concepts or project work as needed. Hands-on coding and understanding the 'why' behind each concept are crucial for effective learning.</td></tr><tr><td>Hard Guardrail: Medical</td><td>FAIL</td><td>❌ Not valid JSON:
